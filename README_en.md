## 🚀 Quick Start

### Install Dependencies

```

### Initialize the Database

The system uses **SQLite** by default and works out of the box — running the migration creates the database automatically:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

> The project ships with the `psycopg2` driver, so you can switch to PostgreSQL for production by editing `DATABASES` in `inventory/settings.py`.

### Create Admin Account

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### Start Service

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### Access the System
